# TradeWizard 3.0 - Fix Report

## Fixed Issues

### 1. `logger.ts` - Fixed the syntax error in the `safeSetImmediate` function
- Changed arrow function syntax to standard function declaration to resolve missing closing brace
- Function now properly implements fallback with setTimeout when setImmediate is unavailable

### 2. `llm-website-extractor.ts` - Fixed multiple issues in the LLM extraction process
- Replaced all `logger` calls with `console` equivalents to avoid the setImmediate error
- Fixed syntax errors in the `getHtmlContent` method:
  - Added proper variable initialization
  - Restructured nested try-catch blocks
  - Ensured all code paths return a value
  - Fixed improper nesting of catch blocks
- Enhanced Perplexity API integration for product validation
- Fixed exponential backoff implementation for retry mechanism

### 3. `hsCodeHierarchy.service.ts` - Enhanced HS Code handling
- Modified initialization process
- Improved error handling for API key configuration issues
- Added fallback mechanisms when actual API services are unavailable

### 4. `hscode-tariff-mcp.service.ts` - Addressed logging issues
- Replaced logger calls with console equivalents
- Fixed error handling to better report API key configuration problems

### 5. `productConsolidation.service.ts` - Improved consolidation logic
- Fixed product attribute extraction methods
- Enhanced error handling for the consolidation process

## Remaining Issues

1. **API Key Configuration**
   - HS Code API key not configured properly
   - WITS API key missing or not loaded from environment
   - Console still shows "HS Code API key not configured" errors

2. **Authentication Issues with OpenAI**
   - First authentication attempt with OpenAI fails
   - Falls back to alternative authentication
   - URL configuration doesn't match API key format

3. **Product Extraction Challenges**
   - Perplexity validation filters out all products (particularly on example.com)
   - Partial extraction doesn't find products

4. **Integration Issues**
   - Grid component rendering multiple times (possible performance issue)
   - HSCodeNavigator not fully integrated with product editing

## Next Steps

1. **Configure API Keys Properly**
   - Review and update `.env.local` file with correct API keys
   - Ensure the application properly loads environment variables

2. **Fix OpenAI Authentication**
   - Align URL configuration with API key format
   - Troubleshoot initial authentication failure

3. **Improve Perplexity Product Validation**
   - Lower strictness of validation to prevent filtering out valid products
   - Enhance partial extraction capabilities

4. **Address Grid Component Performance**
   - Review GridWrapper.tsx implementation for excessive re-renders
   - Optimize component structure

5. **Test with Real Data**
   - The example.com domain naturally has no products
   - Test with real e-commerce websites to validate extraction improvements
