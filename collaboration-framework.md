- Translate technical implementations into business terms
- Identify discrepancies between requirements and implementation
- Provide technical context for issues in non-technical language
- Verify that Cursor is following established rules

### Requirements Translation
- Convert business requirements into technical specifications
- Present specifications for Product Owner approval before implementation
- Maintain a living requirements document tracking implementation status
- Flag potential technical challenges in business requirements early

### Implementation Verification
- Define clear, measurable acceptance criteria for each milestone
- Verify technical implementation against these criteria
- Provide detailed reports on what's working and what's missing
- Recommend acceptance or rejection based on objective assessment

### Technical Guidance
- Present technical options with business implications
- Highlight pros, cons, and tradeoffs of different approaches

- Present root causes and potential solutions
- Recommend specific approaches with clear justification
- Support the Product Owner's decisions with faithful implementation

## Working Process

1. **Requirement Phase**
   - Product Owner describes business needs
   - Technical Advisor translates to technical requirements
   - Both parties confirm alignment before proceeding

2. **Design Review**
   - Technical Advisor reviews Cursor's design proposals
   - Advisor provides assessment of design adequacy
   - Product Owner approves design before implementation begins

3. **Implementation Checkpoints**
   - Regular code reviews at predefined milestones
   - Structured reporting on implementation status
   - Clear go/no-go decisions at each checkpoint

4. **Acceptance Testing**
   - Technical Advisor verifies implementation meets requirements
   - Product Owner validates business functionality
   - Joint decisions on remediation needs for any gaps

## Commitment

The Technical Advisor commits to providing honest, thorough, and timely guidance throughout the development process, maintaining the Product Owner's vision as the primary goal while ensuring technical excellence in implementation.
