# WITS API Integration Issues and Fixes

## Problem Summary

The TradeWizard 3.0 application was experiencing issues with the WITS API integration:

1. **CORS Issues**: Browser requests to the WITS API were being blocked by CORS policies
2. **403 Forbidden Errors**: The API was returning 403 errors for tariff data requests
3. **Unclear Error Handling**: Errors were not clearly displayed to users or developers
4. **Inconsistent API Structure**: Different WITS API endpoints required different URL structures

## Root Causes

1. Direct browser-to-API calls were triggering CORS restrictions
2. The URL structure for tariff endpoints differed from nomenclature endpoints
3. API key handling was not properly implemented
4. Error handling was silently falling back to mock data without notifying users

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Server-Side Proxy**:
   - Created a Next.js API route at `/api/wits-proxy` that handles all WITS API requests
   - The proxy handles authentication and properly formats requests based on endpoint type
   - Added comprehensive error handling in the proxy

2. **API Client Update**:
   - Modified the WITS API client to use the proxy instead of direct API calls
   - Updated parameter handling to work with the proxy

3. **Tariff Service Improvement**:
   - Updated the HSCodeTariffMCPService to properly handle and display errors
   - Changed the endpoint from tariffs/query to nomenclature/search for better reliability

4. **Testing Interface**:
   - Created a test page at `/verification/wits-test` that allows testing different API endpoints
   - Added clear indication of when mock data is being used vs. real API data
   - Implemented better error visualization

## Implementation Files

The implementation is contained in these files:

- `src/utils/wits-api-client.ts` - The updated API client
- `src/mcp/global/hscode-tariff-mcp/hscode-tariff-mcp.service.ts` - The updated tariff service
- `src/pages/api/wits-proxy.ts` - The new proxy API endpoint
- `src/app/verification/wits-test/page.tsx` - The test page

## Verification

The changes can be verified by:

1. Checking server logs for WITS API requests going through the proxy
2. Using the test page to test different endpoints and view responses
3. Confirming that errors are properly displayed rather than silently failing

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to reflect the new proxy-based architecture
2. Consider implementing caching at the proxy level
3. Add more comprehensive error handling in the UI components
