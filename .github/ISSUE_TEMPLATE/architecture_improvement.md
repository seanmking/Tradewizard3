## Current Architecture Component
Identify the specific component or pattern in the current architecture that you think needs improvement.

## Current Limitations
Describe the limitations, issues, or technical debt in the current implementation:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Scalability concerns
- Maintainability issues
- Testing difficulties
- Other architectural challenges

## Proposed Improvement
Provide a detailed description of your proposed architecture improvement:
- Changes to component relationships
- New architectural patterns
- Refactoring suggestions
- Technology migrations

## Expected Benefits
List the expected benefits of implementing this architectural improvement:
- Performance improvements (with metrics if possible)
- Code maintainability enhancements
- Developer experience improvements
- Scalability benefits
- Other expected improvements

## Implementation Approach
Suggest an implementation approach that minimizes disruption:
- Phased migration strategy
- Required refactoring steps
- Testing strategy
- Backward compatibility considerations

## MCP Architecture Impact
If applicable, describe how this improvement would affect the MCP architecture:
- Changes to MCP interfaces
- Improvements to MCP implementation
- New MCP capabilities

## Code Examples
Provide sample code or pseudocode that illustrates your proposed architecture:

```typescript
// Before
class ExistingImplementation {
  // Current implementation...
}

// After
class ImprovedImplementation {
  // Proposed implementation...
}
```

## Migration Complexity
Indicate the complexity of migrating to the proposed architecture:
- [ ] Low (contained changes with minimal dependencies)
- [ ] Medium (affects multiple components but with clear migration path)
- [ ] High (requires significant rearchitecting)

## Alternative Approaches
Describe any alternative approaches you've considered and why you prefer the proposed solution.

## References
Include links to relevant documentation, articles, or examples that support your proposed architectural improvement.
