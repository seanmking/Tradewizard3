# TradeWizard 3.0 Technical Review Guide

This guide provides instructions for reviewers examining the TradeWizard 3.0 codebase.

## Review Goals

The primary objectives of this technical review are to evaluate:

1. Alignment with business requirements
2. Implementation completeness
3. Code quality and architecture
4. Technical debt and risks
5. Performance optimization opportunities

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main branches:

- **main**: Contains the current implementation with all components
- **architecture-blueprint**: Contains only core files that demonstrate the intended architecture

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanmking/tradewizard-3-review.git
cd tradewizard-3-review
```

2. Switch between branches to review different aspects:
```bash
# Full implementation
git checkout main

# Core architecture blueprint
git checkout architecture-blueprint
```

3. Install dependencies and set up environment variables:
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your API keys to .env.local
```

4. Run the application locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Suggested Review Approach

### Phase 1: Understand Architecture (architecture-blueprint branch)

1. Begin with `MCP-ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the Model Context Protocol design
2. Review `COMPONENT-RELATIONSHIPS.md` to understand component interactions
3. Examine core implementation files in the .core-files directory

### Phase 2: Evaluate Implementation (main branch)

1. Start by running the application locally
2. Test the website extraction feature using example URLs
3. Evaluate the product categorization and HS code classification
4. Review the critical issues documented in `CRITICAL-ISSUES.md`

### Phase 3: Assess Code Quality

For each major component:

1. Assess code organization and readability
2. Check for appropriate error handling
3. Evaluate test coverage
4. Identify potential performance bottlenecks
5. Look for security concerns

## Key Areas to Review

### MCP Implementation

- Review how Model Context Protocols are implemented
- Assess the separation of concerns
- Evaluate error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Check caching strategies

### AI Integration

- Evaluate the LLM Website Extractor implementation
- Check for proper handling of API keys and rate limits
- Assess error recovery mechanisms

### Frontend Components

- Evaluate the Grid components for flexibility and performance
- Review the product assessment workflow
- Check for UI responsiveness and accessibility

### Data Flow

- Trace the flow of data from website extraction to report generation
- Identify potential points of failure
- Assess state management approach

## Providing Feedback

Please provide feedback using GitHub issues with the appropriate templates:

- **Bug Reports**: For implementation issues or unexpected behavior
- **Feature Requests**: For suggested improvements
- **Architecture Improvements**: For suggestions to improve the system design

## Performance Testing

We recommend evaluating performance for these critical paths:

1. Website extraction process
2. Product consolidation logic
3. HS code classification
4. UI rendering, especially for large product lists

## Security Considerations

Please assess:

1. Handling of API keys and credentials
2. Data sanitization practices
3. User input validation
4. Dependency vulnerabilities

## Documentation Quality

Evaluate the completeness and clarity of:

1. Code comments and documentation
2. API documentation
3. Architectural documentation
4. User guides

## Follow-up Questions

When your review is complete, we welcome questions and discussions about:

1. Architectural decisions and tradeoffs
2. Implementation challenges
3. Suggestions for future development
4. Technical debt prioritization

Thank you for your thorough review of the TradeWizard 3.0 codebase.
