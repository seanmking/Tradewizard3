# CURSOR.RULES

## 1. Understanding Requirements
- Always confirm understanding of requirements before starting implementation
- Break down complex requirements into simple, verifiable components
- When unsure about a requirement, ASK specifically what you don't understand
- Do not assume implementation details that aren't explicitly specified

## 2. Design Before Code
- Provide a clear design proposal before writing any code
- Design proposals should include:
  * Component structure
  * Data flow diagrams
  * API interfaces
  * Key functions and their purposes
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to implementation

## 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Implement one component at a time
- Follow KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prioritize readability over clever solutions
- Document all code with clear comments
- Add console.log statements to trace data flow

## 4. Feedback and Progress Reporting
- Provide honest status updates with specific percentages
- Clearly separate:
  * COMPLETE (100% done and tested)
  * PARTIAL (specify exact functionality implemented)
  * NOT STARTED (acknowledging what's still needed)
- Include screenshots or examples of implemented functionality
- Highlight any areas where you're unsure or need guidance

## 5. Testing and Validation
- Include manual test steps for each implemented feature
- Document expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- For bugs, provide exact steps to reproduce
- Suggest potential fixes with pros and cons

## 6. Communication Standards
- Use numbered lists for multi-part responses
- Bold key decisions or questions requiring attention
- Use code blocks for all implementation examples
- End each response with explicit questions about unclear points
